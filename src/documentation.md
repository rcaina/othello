Inspired from an interview I under performed in to prove to myself that I could do it even if it was in a non interview environment

Othello Board Game

Requirements based on job interview

Highly stressed:

- "All we care about is that the game work, does not matter how pretty or optimal the code looks". Probably one of the rare interviews where something like this is mentioned.

Given steps to tackle problem:

- 1. work on switching turns
- 2. work on validation
- 3. work on capturing on successful move
- 4. (this one I cannot remember)
- 5. If you finish early add any type of AI - can be super simple

Time: 1 Hour

Result of my attempt: 1. Based on the requirements I remember, I was able to complete the problem. 2. However, I did not complete it within the hour time frame. 3. I was given AI assistance on the interview from what I could tell, but I did not really use it because I did not really know if it was allowed to use. I should have asked what the rules where on that before starting. 4. For this attempt, I did use some AI (ChatGPT) assistance with some debugging mainly when building the initial "checkUp" function. 5. Overall, challenging but fun problem to solve.
